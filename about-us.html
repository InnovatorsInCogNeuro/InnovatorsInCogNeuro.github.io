                        <p><strong>The Innovators in Cognitive Neuroscience Symposia welcomes thought-leaders exploring the neural mechanisms that give rise to thought, knowledge, and complex behavior.</strong> Even as novel technologies, methods, and analytical tools proliferate, we believe it is the diverse and creative individuals within the neuroscience community that are most critical for moving our understanding of the brain forward. We are committed to curating and disseminating innovative theories, as well as a forum for cultivating new ideas.

                        <p><strong>Innovators in cognitive neuroscience are leaders in the field who push the boundaries of current methodological and theoretical frameworks to advance our understanding of the brain.</strong>  Being an inherently multidisciplinary enterprise, innovators come to neuroscience from a variety of academic backgrounds, including cognitive psychology, computer science, and sociology. Innovators may be working in academia, clinical settings, government, or industry.
                        </p>

                        <p><strong>Importantly, underrepresented groups have been among the greatest innovators in academic research, but historically these individuals have not been fully recognized for their contributions.</strong> The Innovators in Cognitive Neuroscience Symposia is committed to amplifying the voices of innovators from historically underrepresented groups, and to cultivating a just and equal environment in academia.</p>

                        <p><strong>Scientific research does not take place in a vacuum, and we believe that it is crucial for scientists to take a lead in creating a just and equal society.</strong> To this end, we encourage our speakers to donate 50% of their honorarium to a charitable cause, which will be announced during the introduction of the speaker.</p>
