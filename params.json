{"name":"Innovators in cognitive neuroscience","tagline":"Leading science and social change","body":"## Mission statement\r\nThe Innovators in Cognitive Neuroscience Symposia welcomes thought-leaders exploring the neural mechanisms that give rise to thought, knowledge, and complex behavior. Even as novel technologies, methods, and analytical tools proliferate, we believe it is the diverse and creative individuals within the neuroscience community that are most critical for moving our understanding of the brain forward. We are committed to curating and disseminating innovative theories, as well as a forum for cultivating new ideas.\r\n\r\n***\r\n## Upcoming talks\r\nList of speakers.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n## Who are innovators?\r\nInnovators in cognitive neuroscience are leaders in the field who push the boundaries of current methodological and theoretical frameworks to advance our understanding of the brain. Being an inherently multidisciplinary enterprise, innovators come to neuroscience from a variety of academic backgrounds, including cognitive psychology, computer science, and sociology. Innovators may be working in academia, clinical settings, government, or industry.\r\n\r\nImportantly, underrepresented groups have been among the greatest innovators in academic research, but historically these individuals have not been fully recognized for their contributions. The Innovators in Cognitive Neuroscience Symposia is committed to amplifying the voices of \r\ninnovators from historically underrepresented groups, and to cultivating a just and equal environment in academia.\r\n\r\n## Commitment to social justice through science\r\nScientific research does not take place in a vacuum, and we believe that it is crucial for scientists to take a lead in creating a just and equal society. To this end, in addition to an honorarium, we will offer to make a cash donation for each speaker in their name to the social justice cause of their choice. \r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Organizers\r\n\r\n### Dartmouth College\r\n\r\n\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
